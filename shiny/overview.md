##### Game of Thrones:  Got Data?


* Our Project will attempt to predict the demographic user ratings of a Game of Thrones episode based on <br>
the characters and their associated screen time in the episode.<br>

* Our approach

     1. Acquire/Scrape the IMDB ratings, which include ratings per
     demographic (gender and age).

     2. Use an existing data source of all Game of Thrones Episodes and
     every characters time on screen per episode.

     3. Explore recommendation approaches and build a model to train on 70% of the data.

     4. Use the remaining 30% of the episodes in various combinations to
     to predict the rating each demographic will assign the episode
     based on the character data.
